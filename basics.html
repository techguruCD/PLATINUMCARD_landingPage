                  <p><h4>What is this all about?</h4><br>
                  Travel hacking is, for most people, about stretching thier travel budget. Travelling for less means more travelling! For some it's about asperiational flights in Business Class to far off places and staying in five star hotels. To others its being able to afford to take the kids to Florida for a family vacation. There is no 'wrong' way to do it.... though there are more efficent ways. That's part of why I've created this site. To take a hobby I've enjoyed and a passion for travel and use my knowledge to help others do the same thing. <br><br>
                 
                  <p><h4>Why are you qualified to teach me anything?</h4><br>
                  I've been travelling internationally for nearly 30 years and 'Travel Hacking' for a decade and points quickly become a very interesting hobby for me. I've earned and redeemed over 4 Million points. I currently have 1.2M aeroplan points. I've been to 30 countries on five continents. Some of my best use of points over the years are getting free hotels rooms during Octoberfest in Munich and in Walt Disney World over Christmas, flying business class on 8 different airlines, my family has flown business class to Europe together, I've even used points for an All Inclusive vacation! This isn't to brag, but to show you what is possible.<br><br>
                  <p><h4>Who should collect points?</h4><br>
                  It is not for everyone. Signing up for credit cards to get the bonuses is a LARGE part of the hobby. If you're someone who has a bad credit or doesn't pay your current bills on time this might not be for you. You want to be earning points, not paying interest. If you can't see yourself keeping track of when to make your minimum spending by or when you should cancel a card it might not be for you. If you're are someone who is responsible with credit already, who want's to put a little work into getting something for 'almost' nothing, and you like to travel this is the hobby for you. <br><br>
                  <p><h4>Can I really travel for free?</h4><br>
                  Let me be 100% honets. No. You will not travel for free. There are people out there that might lead you to believe that, but the fact is my realistic goal is HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED travel. Most credit cards have annual fees. Some are large. The value you get far exceeds these fees of course, but you still have to spend some money. I guess technically you could get a no fee card and start earning points but it will take the average person years to earn enough points that way to pay for a trip. On the flip side you could apply for certain AMEX cards and use a large portion of the points to pay for the annual fee, but since you get much better value using those points through Aeroplan I think its a step in the wrong direction even if you could technically not pay anything for the card that way. You can read more about how to calculate value in my other guides. <br>  <br>               
                  <p><h4>Will this affect my credit score?</h4><br>
                  It's a very common question, but contrary to popular belief applying doesn't have to mean a drop in credit score. Even if you apply for multiple cards. Your credit score is composed of many different factors: payment history (35%), credit utilization (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit applications (10%), and credit types (10%), etc. I follow my credit score for free at borrowwell.com and find that applying for a couple of cards in the same month has little effect. I've noticed a drop of up to 10 points that seems to reverse in the next 1-2 months. That could be for the credit inquiry, or it could be the money I'm putting through the cards to make the minimum spend, but it has never been a permenant drop.<br> <br>
                  <p><h4>This seems to good to be true. What's the catch?</h4><br>
                  The catch is that you have to do a little work. I'm trying to make it easier for people to join me in this hobby, but you have to be the one to keep track of your own applications, renewal dates and minimum spending requirements. I have a few more guides to help, but there is a little bit of a learning curve, like any hobby. I enjoy it and hope many of you will as well. There aren't too many hobbies that effectivly make you money, but I've found one that allowes me to have experiences I never would have been able to afford if I was paying retail for my flights and hotels.<br>      <br>             <p><h4>Where do I start?</h4><br>
                 If you've made it this far you already have! There are a few other guides that go in to more detail on a few aspects of collecting and redeeming points that may be worth a look. The next step would be to actually start earning. There are a number of options, but with hotels and flights being the biggest cost for most vacations I think there is a good case to start the process of earning both with Aeroplan and Marriott being my choice for anyone trying to earn and redeem in Canada. If you want to start with one I would focus on flights and while earning Aeroplan points directly through a card make some sense, I would look at earning Membership Rewards points through another AMEX card as the bonuses are more generous and they transfer 1 to 1 into Aeroplan so it's basically the same thing. <br>
